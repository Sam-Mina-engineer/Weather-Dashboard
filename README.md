Weather Dashboard
I am going to start by laying out the HTML.
I am now decorating with the CSS. I am using a blue and green color scheme because those are Earth colors, which I think is appropriate for weather. 
I found a royalty free icon to use as part of my title bar and I am using the CSS to position it. 
At this point in my studies, I am finding HTML and CSS to be fairly straightforward. The JavaScript is going to require deeper thinking, but I love JavaScript, so I am going to really enjoy that part of the project. When I get done with the CSS, I will do a Git Push and then start pseudocoding the JavaScript.
